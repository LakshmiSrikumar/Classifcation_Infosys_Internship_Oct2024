1.  Assignment 1: Comprehensive Image Processing and Boundary Analysis  

Image Acquisition:
Capture or download an image, such as a flower vase (refer to the provided link shared during the meeting).

Edge Detection:
Apply edge detection techniques like Canny or Sobel to identify the edges in the image.

Binary Conversion:
Convert the image into a binary format using a thresholding method (e.g., Otsu's thresholding).

Binary Image Preprocessing:
Apply binary image preprocessing techniques, including noise removal using morphological operations (e.g., dilation and erosion).

Boundary Detection:
Use Hough Transform or other suitable boundary detection techniques to identify and mark the boundaries in the binary image.

Output Generation:
Produce and present the final binary output image showcasing clear boundary detection.
